# Code Analyzer Agent

**Module 2 Project: Advanced Prompting for Engineering**

## 🎯 Project Overview

Build an intelligent code analysis agent that can examine codebases, identify issues, suggest improvements, and answer questions about code. This project focuses on advanced prompting techniques including Chain-of-Thought, few-shot learning, and multimodal analysis.

## 📋 Requirements

### Core Features
- [ ] Parse and analyze code files
- [ ] Identify code smells and anti-patterns
- [ ] Suggest refactoring opportunities
- [ ] Answer questions about code functionality
- [ ] Generate code documentation

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Multi-file analysis and dependency tracking
- [ ] Screenshot/diagram analysis (multimodal)
- [ ] Custom analysis rules
- [ ] Integration with version control

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Recommended:
- **Language:** Python
- **LLM Integration:** OpenAI API, Anthropic Claude API, or similar
- **Code Parsing:** AST libraries (ast, tree-sitter, etc.)
- **CLI Framework:** Click, argparse, or Typer
