### Analysis
Based on weighted scoring for AI training/development work:
1. **Cursor**: 485 points (Winner - Best IDE integration + quality)
2. **GitHub Copilot**: 484 points (Very close - Great all-rounder)
3. **Gemini CLI**: 469 points (Fast, good value)
4. **Claude Code**: 464 points (Strong terminal tool)

### My Tool Selection

**Primary Tool:** **GitHub Copilot** (already installed in VS Code)

**Why:** 
- Already integrated and familiar
- Excellent inline suggestions for fast coding
- Great documentation and community support
- Works seamlessly with my existing VS Code workflow
- Good balance of speed, quality, and ease of use
- 484/670 points in my prioritization

**Backup Tool:** **Cursor IDE** (for complex multi-file refactoring)

**Why:** 
- Best for when I need deep codebase understanding
- Excellent for architectural changes across multiple files
- Higher context awareness than Copilot
- Worth learning for complex projects
- Can import VS Code settings easily

**For Learning/Exploration:** **Claude Code CLI** or **API directly**

**Why:**
- Best for understanding concepts thoroughly (as seen in model comparison)
- Terminal-based fits my workflow
- Can use DeepSeek or Claude for detailed explanations

**Tools I'm Currently Using:**
- [x] GitHub Copilot (primary - in VS Code)
- [ ] Cursor (planning to try for Day 3 multi-agent work)
- [ ] Claude Code / Sonnet for VS Code
- [ ] Continue.dev
- [x] Other: **Direct API calls** (OpenAI, DeepSeek for learning)
