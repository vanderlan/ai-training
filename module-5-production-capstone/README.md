# Module 5: Production & Capstone

**Production Deployment & Final Project**

## 🎯 Module Overview

This module focuses on production-ready AI systems, covering rate limiting, caching, security, cost optimization, and responsible AI practices. You'll apply everything learned to build and deploy a capstone project.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### Production Considerations
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Caching strategies
- Security best practices
- Cost optimization
- Error handling and retry logic
- Monitoring and alerting

### Responsible AI
- Bias detection and mitigation
- Privacy and data protection
- Transparency and explainability
- Governance frameworks

### Deployment
- CI/CD pipelines
- Environment management
- Scaling strategies
- Demo and showcase preparation

## 🎯 Capstone Project Options

Choose **ONE** of the following projects:

### Option 1: Code Review Bot
Automated code review system that:
- Reviews pull requests
- Identifies bugs and security issues
- Suggests improvements
- Learns from team patterns

### Option 2: Documenter
Intelligent documentation generator that:
- Creates API documentation
- Generates user guides
- Updates docs automatically
- Maintains doc quality

### Option 3: Tech Debt Analyzer
System to identify and prioritize technical debt:
- Scans codebase for debt
- Calculates impact scores
- Prioritizes remediation
- Tracks improvements

### Option 4: Multi-Agent System
Custom multi-agent system of your choice:
- Design agent architecture
- Implement coordination
- Solve complex workflow
- Demonstrate value
