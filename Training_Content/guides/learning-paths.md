# 🗺️ Learning Paths - After the Training

Structured roadmaps for continuing your AI engineering journey after completing this 5-day intensive program. Choose your path based on your goals and interests.

---

## 🎯 How to Use This Guide

**After completing this 5-day intensive training, you have the fundamentals. These paths show how to go from "I understand AI" to "I'm productive building AI systems professionally."**

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Assess Your Goals** - What do you want to build or achieve?
   - Building products? → AI Product Engineer path
   - Scaling systems? → AI Infrastructure Engineer path
   - Love research? → Research Engineer path
   - Consulting/Strategy? → AI Consultant/Architect path

2. **Choose Your Path** - Pick ONE roadmap (you can switch later)
   - Don't try to do everything at once
   - Focus = faster progress

3. **Follow the Sequence** - Complete milestones in order
   - Each month builds on the previous
   - Skipping steps creates knowledge gaps

4. **Build Projects** - Learning by doing is 10x more effective than reading
   - Every week, complete at least one hands-on project
   - Deploy everything (even if buggy)

5. **Track Progress** - Use the checkboxes to monitor your journey
   - Check off tasks as you complete them
   - Review monthly to stay on track

### Time Investment & Reality Check:

**Each path requires 3-6 months of dedicated learning:**
- **Part-time (10-15 hours/week)**: 4-6 months to job-ready
- **Full-time (30-40 hours/week)**: 2-3 months to job-ready

**Breakdown:**
- 50% hands-on building projects
- 30% learning new concepts
- 20% reading papers, engaging with community

**What "job-ready" means:**
- Can build and deploy production AI applications
- Understand tradeoffs between approaches
- Can debug AI systems independently
- Have portfolio of 3-5 deployed projects
