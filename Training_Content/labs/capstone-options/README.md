# Capstone Project Options

Choose one of the four capstone projects below. Each includes starter code, requirements, and evaluation criteria.

## Option Overview

| Option | Project | Complexity | Key Skills |
|--------|---------|------------|------------|
| **A** | AI Code Review Bot | Medium | Prompting, API design |
| **B** | Legacy Code Documenter | Medium-High | Agents, code analysis |
| **C** | Tech Debt Analyzer | High | RAG, evaluation |
| **D** | Multi-Agent Research Assistant | High | Multi-agent, orchestration |

---

## Option A: AI Code Review Bot

Build a bot that automatically reviews code and provides structured feedback.

**Features:**
- Accept code via API endpoint
- Analyze for bugs, security, performance, style
- Return categorized, actionable feedback
- Support multiple languages

**Directory**: `option-a-code-review/`

---

## Option B: Legacy Code Documenter

Build an agent that generates documentation for undocumented code.

**Features:**
- Parse and analyze code files
- Generate function/class documentation
- Create README with project overview
- CLI interface for easy use

**Directory**: `option-b-documenter/`

---

## Option C: Tech Debt Analyzer

Build a RAG-enhanced system for identifying and prioritizing technical debt.

**Features:**
- Index codebase with semantic search
- Detect tech debt patterns
- Score and prioritize issues
- Generate actionable reports

**Directory**: `option-c-tech-debt/`

---

## Option D: Multi-Agent Research Assistant

Build an orchestrated multi-agent system for technical research tasks.

**Features:**
- Multiple specialized agents (researcher, writer, reviewer)
- Task decomposition and delegation
- Result synthesis
- Report generation

**Directory**: `option-d-research-assistant/`

## Getting Started

1. **Choose your project** based on interests and complexity comfort
2. **Navigate to the directory**: `cd option-[x]-[name]/`
3. **Read the README** for specific requirements
4. **Use the starter code** as your foundation
5. **Build, test, and deploy** within the time limit
6. **Prepare your demo** following the presentation guidelines

---

## Time Management

| Phase | Time | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| Setup | 15 min | Get starter code running |
| Core Features | 1 hr | Implement main functionality |
| Polish | 30 min | Error handling, edge cases |
| Deploy | 15 min | Deploy and verify |
| Demo Prep | 15 min | Prepare presentation |
| Buffer | 15 min | Handle unexpected issues |

**Total: ~2.5 hours**

---

## Evaluation Quick Reference

Your project will be evaluated on:
- **Core Functionality** (40%): Does it work?
- **Architecture** (20%): Is it well-structured?
- **Production Ready** (20%): Is it deployed and robust?
- **Documentation** (10%): Is it documented?
- **Presentation** (10%): Can you demo it?

## Tips for Success

1. **Start simple**: Get basic functionality working first
2. **Test early**: Don't wait until the end to test
3. **Deploy early**: Deploy a working skeleton first, then iterate
4. **Manage scope**: Cut features if running behind, not quality
5. **Prepare demo**: Decide what to show before you finish coding
